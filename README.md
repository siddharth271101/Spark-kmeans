### Background
LoudAcre Mobile is a mobile phone service provider which has introduced a new open network campaign. As a part of this campaign, the company has invited users to raise a request to initiate a complaint about the towers in their locality, if they face issues with their mobile network. LoudAcre has collected the dataset of users who had raised the complaint.
### Problem Description
The fourth and the fifth field of the dataset has latitude and longitude of users which is an important information for the company. You have to find this information of latitude and longitude on the basis of available dataset and create three clusters of users with a k-means algorithm.
### Conclusion
Succesfully divided the userâ€™s location data(latitude and longitude) into three clusters with centers [34.544,-118.055],[39.922,-121.384],[35.085,-112.576].This will further help the company improve their service by maximising the coverage for its users.
